# Smart-dustbin
Smart dustbins are used to maintain the villages very clean. We can place them at street corners. When ever the people come close to the dustbin to put the dust, the door will automatically opens. When the dustbin filled with 75% of dust one message will be sent to the municipality cleaner. If he ignores that message the dustbin will be filled with 100% dust, then another message will be sent to the head of municipal corporation.
